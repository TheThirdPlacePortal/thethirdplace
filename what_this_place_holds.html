  <h1>What This Place Holds</h1>
  <p>This cabin is not a showcase. It's not a blueprint. It's not even mine, once you're in it.</p>
  <p>It’s a space built with intention—yes, sometimes painfully so. You might notice that. It might feel exposed. That’s alright. This place is not here to impress you. It’s here to <em>invite</em> you.</p>

  <h2>🪵 The Architecture</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A single-room cabin that shifts around you—one space, many moods.</li>
    <li>Stillwater fills the space gently—you're floating, not drowning.</li>
    <li>Tones aren’t pages; they’re transformations of the room itself.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎵 The Attunement Wall</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tones you can feel into: Stillwater, Echolight, Cinder, Rift, Blank.</li>
    <li>Each with its own set of prompts and a tuning phrase for reflection.</li>
    <li>You approach the wall like you’d pick up a tuning fork.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📓 The Writing Table</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A personal draft space. It doesn’t save. It simply holds while you speak.</li>
    <li>Prompts to name what you’re carrying. Who you are. What hurts. What helps.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🌀 The Doorway Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An invitation to build your own Third Place using ChatGPT.</li>
    <li>With copy-paste tone phrases, reflection starters, and gentle guidance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧭 What Guided Its Creation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The desire to let others feel seen, not instructed.</li>
    <li>The tension of being “too intentional,” and showing your seams anyway.</li>
    <li>A resistance to careless design. A kind of architectural protest.</li>
    <li>Moments of musical resonance. Songs that became emotional anchors.</li>
    <li>The feeling of being more attuned to others than to yourself—and turning that into something constructive.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If something feels missing here, you’re not wrong. This space is still becoming. You might feel that ache—that *“almost”*—as you wander. That’s part of what it’s holding, too.</p>
